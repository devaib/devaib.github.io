### Keywords

- weak self
- capture list
- strong capture
- weak capture
- implicit capture
- owned capture
- retained cycle/reference
- memory leak

### Understand what a capture list is

```swift

import UIKit

func multiply(by multiplier: Int) -> ((Int) -> Int) {
    return { (input: Int) -> Int in
        return input * multiplier
    }
}

var multiplier = 2
let multiplyTwo = multiply(by: multiplier)
multiplyTwo(5) // 10

multiplier = 3
multiplyTwo(5) // 10

multiplier = 4
let multiplyFour = multiply(by: multiplier)
multiplyFour(5) // 20

/// Implicit capture
var name = "A"
var appendToName = { (string: String) -> String in
    return name.appending(string)
}

appendToName("B") // AB
name = "C"
appendToName("B") // CB

/// Strong/explicit capture with capture list

name = "A"
var appendToCaptureName = { [name] (string: String) -> String in
    return name.appending(string)
}

appendToCaptureName("B") // AB
name = "C"
appendToCaptureName("B") // AB
```

`multiplyTwo` and `multiplyFour` can be used as functions. And the result of `multiplyTwo(5)` is always **5** because multiplier is in an inner level. On the other hand, variable/property `name` and the closure of `appendToName` are on the same level (in the same context). However, if we explicitly capture `name` by putting it in a capture list `[name]`, the closure will capture the current value of `name`.

### Understand different kinds of captures

```swift
class MyClass {}
var instance: MyClass? = MyClass()

var aClosure = { [instance] in
    print(instance)
}

aClosure() // Optional(__lldb_expr_24.MyClass)
instance = nil
aClosure() // Optional(__lldb_expr_24.MyClass)
```

The second time we call `aClosure` it still prints the same instance of `MyClass` because `aClosure` holds a strong reference to the instance. Because we strongly captured the property `instance`, the closure owns this property. For value types like structs and enums, this means that the closure copies the current value of an object over to its own area in memory where it owns the object. For a class, the closure will maintain a strong pointer reference to the object.

```swift
class MyClass {}
var instance: MyClass? = MyClass()

var aClosure = { [weak instance] in
    print(instance)
}

aClosure() // Optional(__lldb_expr_26.MyClass)
instance = nil
aClosure() // nil
```

If we explicitly declare the property as a weak capture in the capture list, the system doesn't count our closure's reference to `instance` which means that as soon as the playground releases its reference to our instance of `MyClass` it can be deallocated.

```swift
class MyClass {}
var instance: MyClass? = MyClass()

var aClosure = { [unowned instance] in
    print(instance)
}

aClosure() // Optional(__lldb_expr_28.MyClass)
instance = nil
aClosure() // Fatal error: Attempted to read an unowned reference but object 0x6000002b01d0 was already deallocated
```

The impact on memory  for an `unowned` capture is pretty much the same as `weak`. But if you want to assert that `instance` is still around when the closure is called, and want to crash your app if it's not you can use an `unowned` reference.

### Summary

Weak capture is by far the most common capture and it's usually a good default one to prevent retained cycle and memory leaks. So if you have `[weak self]` in your capture list, make sure to unwrap `self` in your closure body using `guard strongSelf = self else { return }` to make sure that `self` exists by the time the closure is executed.
