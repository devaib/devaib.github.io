### Keynotes

- A *publisher* is an observable object that emits values over time, and that can also optionally complete either when no more values are available, or when it encountered an error.
- Objects or closures that are used to observe a publisher are referred to as *subscribers*.
- A *subject* is a mutable object that can be used to send new values through a publisher. Types like `PassthroughSubject` act as both publishers and subjects.
- *Operators* are used to build reactive chains or pipelines that our data can flow through, where each operator applies some form of transform to the data that was sent to it.
- A *cancellable* is used to keep track of a subscription to a given publisher, and needs to be retained for as long as we want that subscription to remain active.

### Example of using Combine for making a network request

```swift
import UIKit

struct Repository: Codable {
    var name: String
    var url: URL
}

let nameLabel = UILabel()
let errorLabel = UILabel()

let url = URL(string: "https://api.github.com/repos/johnsundell/publish")!
// a publisher that emits `(Data, URLResponse)` values
let publisher = URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
// a publisher that emits `Repository` values
let repoPublier = publisher
    // transform network result values by extracting their `data` property
    .map(\.data)
    // decode `data` and new publisher emits `Repository` values
    .decode(type: Repository.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
    // jump over from background to main thread
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)

let cancellable = repoPublier.sink(
    receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
            errorLabel.text = error.localizedDescription
        case .finished:
            print("Success")
        }
    },
    receiveValue: { repo in
        print(repo)
        nameLabel.text = repo.name
    }
)
```

### Example of creating our own publisher

```swift
import Combine

class Counter {
    private let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
    var publisher: AnyPublisher<Int, Never> {
        subject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
    
    private(set) var value = 0 {
        didSet { subject.send(value) }
    }
    
    func increment() {
        value += 1
    }
}

let counter = Counter()
let cancellable1 = counter.publisher
    .filter { $0 > 2 }
    .sink { value in
        print(value)
    }

counter.increment()
counter.increment()
counter.increment()
```
